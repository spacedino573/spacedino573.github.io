# Simple HTML CSV Viewer

This is a really simple proof-of-concept showing how one can use JavaScript and AJAX to dynamically load a CSV from a Google Sheet and display it as an HTML table in a web page.

The example is based off the [Reading a CSV File Using jQuery and Display into HTML Table](https://www.js-tutorials.com/jquery-tutorials/reading-csv-file-using-jquery/) tutorial, and leverages Google Sheets functionality to [publish spreadsheets as CSV files](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/183965).

You can view this example on [GitHub Pages](https://mattcen.github.io/simple-html-csv-viewer)
